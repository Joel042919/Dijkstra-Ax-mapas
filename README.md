# Dijkstra-Ax-mapas
I used Dijkstra's algorithm and A* for calculate the shortest path on the real streets of Trujillo, Peru. I obtained the street data from OpenStreetMap. At the end of the process, we generated an image showing the outline of the shortest path between the two points (origin - destination)
